the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder, the
game-keeper, lost sight of them. the boscombe pool is thickly wooded
round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. a girl
of fourteen, patience moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of
the boscombe valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.
she states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood
